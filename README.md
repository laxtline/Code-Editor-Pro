# CodeLab / Code Editor Pro

A static coding and placement practice app with an editor, judged exercises, contests, mock exams, theory lessons and a bundled offline study library. No build step is needed to use or deploy the generated app.

## Version 3.0 upgrades

- **Study Material**: separate DSA, Python, Web Development, AI/ML, Core CS, App, Desktop and Placement/Projects subject pages. A course strip, topic sidebar, Previous/Next links, search, editable worked examples, exercises, lesson quizzes, personal notes and interview answers follow a familiar tutorial layout with original CodeLab content. **30 courses, 145 lessons, 446 interview answers** are bundled. All **276 technical skill rows** in the AI engineer PDF link to lessons; the supplied mobile/desktop/full-stack/project topics are also included. Lesson checkboxes represent self-assessment, not a certificate or a claim of mastery.
- **Smart revision & daily dashboard**: mistakes/unanswered items and weak-topic items enter a 1/3/7/14-day schedule. Correct reviews when due advance the schedule; early reviews do not postpone it; mistakes reset it. MCQs, lesson quizzes and graded coding attempts contribute to daily goals, accuracy, streaks and recommended practice.
- **Exam analysis**: topic accuracy, unanswered counts, measured active time, slowest questions and a targeted next drill. Background periods are excluded. Older reports without measurements show an em dash. Coding feedback keeps per-problem active time.
- **Question variety**: 12 rule-based SVG reasoning items, 12 questions across four original reading passages, and 12 chart/table DI items. The 18 newest DSA tasks include KMP, inversions, shortest paths, SCC/bridges, segment/Fenwick trees, interval DP, matching, binary lifting and digit DP. Counts include existing parameter families and are not claims of unique exam patterns.
- **Realtime online/offline saving**: browser autosave works on GitHub Pages, localhost and the offline edition; editor/lesson notes save immediately. The launcher additionally writes a private **`.codelab-data/progress.json`** backup with per-item clocks and deletion records. Matching legacy browser/folder conflicts offer an explicit choice. Compiler credentials are excluded. **Export/Import** transfers between online/local origins and devices; no cloud account or automatic cross-device sync is configured.
- **Back/Forward**: app buttons and browser history navigate lessons, subject pages, practice/results, library and other main screens. Active assessments save when leaving, retain their deadlines and automatically resume at their session URL after reload.
- **Offline native execution**: the loopback-only launcher detects GCC/Clang and a Java JDK. Native programs use your account permissions, with time/output limits; they are not OS-sandboxed. Java programs use `public class Main`. Install a compiler separately if absent, restart the launcher and inspect **Saving & local tools**. `--no-local-tools` disables native execution while retaining folder backup.
- **Update controls**: Online / Offline shows when a new app revision is waiting. Check manually and apply after finishing or saving/leaving your session. Running code, active modern/Classic exams and another CodeLab tab prevent the update reload. Drafts save before applying; the updated app needs a fresh full offline save. Folder copies update by downloading and extracting the latest ZIP.
- **Progress transfer**: JSON backups capture immediate editor changes, carry format/date/revision metadata and exclude compiler API credentials. Imports still accept older CodeLab files, validate allowed storage keys and field types, preserve existing credentials and restore previous imported values if browser storage runs out. Finish or save/leave a session before importing. Import replaces matching items, so export your current work first.

- **1,138 explained MCQs across 78 topics**: 794 original items, 308 reviewed Classic written questions and 36 reviewed sectional questions. Practice covers quantitative aptitude, reasoning, verbal ability, data interpretation, static awareness/CS and programming output. Numerical families include parameter variations; these counts are questions, not separate question types or official past papers.
- **Theory & formulas**: topic notes, formulas/rules, shortcuts, common traps, worked examples and direct practice links. Learn mode reveals an explanation after answering; timed tests reveal it after submission.
- **Exam workflow**: section deadlines, answer palette, visited/answered/review states, clear response, locked submitted sections, saved-session resume, scoring and topic-wise review. Deadlines continue across reloads and while away. Original exam templates and contests remain accessible.
- **Source-linked exam profiles**: TCS timing follows the linked official hiring page; the RRB profile follows the named CEN 05/2024 structure and subject quotas. Other company, banking, government and entrance profiles are explicitly independent training configurations. Practice counts are distinguished from verified official timings.
- **84 additional judged JSON-I/O tasks**, with Python and JavaScript references checked against explicit sample and edge-case outputs. Problems now has language/basic coding and DSA categories, plus an all-problems view.
- **Three PDF roadmaps** retain all 34 steps, their suggested 140/200/240-question targets and indicative company tags. Stage 1/2/3 group the steps for progressive training. Each step shows its actual linked judged/reference resources separately; targets do not imply that every target has a unique built-in problem. Stage mocks draw from relevant added tasks.
- **Coding exam feedback**: mark coding questions for review, switch instantly between saved per-question drafts/languages/custom cases, and save/leave while the original deadline continues. The latest 20 coding evaluations retain submitted code, per-case input/expected/actual results, errors, timing and worked references. Open these from **Coding exam history**; JSON reports and Export All Progress include this history. Unavailable runtime evaluations retain a null final score and can be retried without duplicating the saved report. Contest resumes retain leaderboard completion. Mobile coding keeps the timer visible and reserves space for exam controls.
- **Online + full offline**: GitHub Pages deployment workflow, installable app metadata, a full offline save covering Python/SQL/Monaco and the study library, and a downloadable ZIP with a loopback-only local launcher. Bundled engines total 25.77 MiB; no CDN is required for the hosted/saved/local-server edition. Python runs in a worker so timeout/Stop can terminate an infinite loop, and both `input()` and `sys.stdin` work. C/C++/Java execute offline through the local launcher when GCC/Clang or a Java JDK is installed; the hosted website and Live Server retain cloud execution.
- **Editor**: immediate local text editing with line numbers, indentation, comments, cursor position, file open/download and focus mode. Bundled Monaco upgrades the local editor when available, preserving drafts and web-tab models; the text editor is immediately usable while it loads. JavaScript runs in a stoppable worker with a timeout. Coding exam drafts, language and custom cases can resume after reload. Missing runtime/compiler access is shown as an incomplete evaluation with saved code, rather than a wrong-answer verdict.
- **Portable single HTML**: `CodeLab-Offline.html` embeds the application, question bank, library packs, diagrams and source license notices. Move this file by itself and open it directly; the complete reading collection and local editor work without sibling files.

No existing feature was intentionally removed. Both Classic MCQ banks now use reviewed questions with worked explanations, formulas/rules and shortcuts. **32 Written-bank entries were corrected or clarified**; this includes ambiguous wording and missing options as well as incorrect answers. The app shows the before/after changes under **Review corrections**. Original snapshots and the change report are retained in `data/legacy-bank.snapshot.json`, `data/aptitude-bank.snapshot.json` and `data/legacy-audit-report.json`.

Mixed practice spreads selection across sections and topics. Answer choices shuffle for each session, retain their order after reload, and use the displayed order for numeric keyboard shortcuts. Classic written and sectional results also offer worked-answer review. The RRB profile draws static awareness rather than DBMS questions; TCS Advanced practice uses the hard pool.

Research sources, official-pattern distinctions and attribution are visible in the app’s Sources screen. The new bank is independently authored teaching material informed by IndiaBIX, CareerRide, GeeksforGeeks, official exam pages and GitHub topic coverage; it does not reproduce those sites’ question banks.

Coverage is a broad foundation, not an exhaustive replacement for every exam syllabus. Current affairs, additional non-verbal puzzle families, descriptive writing, MSQ/NAT formats and complete entrance technical subjects need additional material. Company formats can change.

Study notes are independently written from the supplied syllabus and primary documentation; source links are included per course. They do not embed third-party tutorial pages. Framework, GUI, backend and model-service examples need a suitable project/desktop environment and dependencies; the browser runner supports the explicitly runnable examples. Browser Python includes bundled modules, not desktop `sqlite3`/GUI modules or arbitrary ML packages. Optional external reference links need internet.

## Open the app

All local-use instructions are in **`OFFLINE-START-HERE.md` in this same folder**. VS Code users can open `index.html` with Live Server. On this computer the local workspace configuration opens Vivaldi; its machine-specific browser path is excluded from Git.

For a background localhost server and automatic Vivaldi opening, run `.\Start-CodeLab-Vivaldi.ps1` in this folder. Use `-Stop` to stop that server, or `-LiveServer` to open an already running VS Code Live Server (port 5500). The script auto-detects Vivaldi and does not require npm or internet. See the local guide for full commands.

**Full offline ZIP:** use `downloads/CodeLab-Offline.zip` locally or download it from the website's **Online / Offline** panel. Extract the whole ZIP, then double-click `Start-CodeLab.cmd` on Windows or run `python Start-CodeLab.py` on any system with Python 3.8+. Keep the server window open. Python (bundled standard-library modules), JavaScript, HTML/CSS preview, SQL, Monaco, MCQs, theory and all reading work through localhost without internet or npm. Optional Python packages are not bundled.

**Saved website / installed app:** while online, choose **Online / Offline > Save full app for offline**. Wait for **Ready offline**, then reopen the same website or installed app without internet. The readiness check verifies every required asset for this version. Cache names are isolated by repository path. Install through the panel when the browser offers it, or use its Install app / Add to Home Screen menu. Browser caching can be evicted; keep a ZIP copy and export progress separately. Download the ZIP/single HTML while connected.


Open `CodeLab-Offline.html` for the self-contained edition, or open `index.html` while keeping the **entire project folder** together. The Offline Library works with local files, including statements, reference code, diagrams, drafts, and notes.

For a local server:

```powershell
python Start-CodeLab.py --no-browser
```

Visit [localhost:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173/#library). Node.js is only needed for development tools and browser tests.

## Offline Library

The supplied local source folders produced:

| Content | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Study entries (problems and solution topics) | 1,643 |
| Unique reference solution files | 2,979 |
| Reading documents | 466 |
| Bundled diagrams | 194 |
| Solution languages | 7 |

Search by title, LeetCode ID or topic; filter by difficulty, source, language, and review status. Bookmark entries, mark them reviewed, read different source versions, select a solution language, and copy or download individual files. The workspace saves your draft and revision notes in browser storage. **Export progress** backs these up with existing app progress; restore through Settings → Import Progress.

Imported entries are a reference collection. They are separate from the existing judged Problems bank: LeetCode function signatures, helper types and reference code do not automatically provide a stdin/stdout harness or reliable test cases. Solution-only entries and unspecified difficulties are labeled explicitly. Review marks do not count as judged solves.

When using localhost or an HTTPS deployment, click **Save for offline** and wait for **Ready offline** before disconnecting. This saves all library packs and bundled diagrams, including entries you have not opened yet. Browser storage is specific to the current device, browser, and origin; clearing site data removes cached files and saved progress.

| Feature | Internet needed? |
| --- | --- |
| Bundled library, diagrams, source code, workspace | No, with the project folder or after Save for offline |
| Local text editor and JavaScript execution | No |
| Monaco, Python/Pyodide core, SQLite/sql.js | No, in the full saved website or ZIP through localhost; single HTML uses online engines |
| C, C++, Java execution | No with the launcher + installed compiler; cloud access otherwise |
| External reference links | Yes |

Pyodide 0.26.2, SQL.js 1.14.0 and Monaco 0.45.0 are pinned; runtime notices are in `vendor/runtimes/`.

Seven diagram URLs in the supplied documents could not be bundled; their positions display a placeholder. Imported reading is sanitized, and unavailable external images are not fetched by the reader.

## Sources and attribution

- `Leetcode-Premium-main`: problem descriptions and solution files.
- `Complete-LeetCode-Premium-Problems-master`: problem descriptions and solution files.
- `leetcode-primer-main`: tutorials, tags and JavaScript implementations; MkDocs code includes are expanded into the offline reading. MIT notice retained in `offline/licenses/primer/`.
- `LeetCode-Solutions-main`: structured problems and loose reference solutions. Both supplied MIT notices are retained in `offline/licenses/solutions/`.
- `TheAlgorithms/Python`: 12 MIT-licensed Python algorithm modules, pinned to commit `25c712f2692449e91a57748d328ef34fccf25654`. Source URLs and snapshot are in `data/github-references.json`; the license is in `offline/licenses/algorithms/`.

No license file was supplied in the first two folders. Original source folder names, relative file paths, and duplicate solution origins are retained in each entry. Review source permissions before redistributing content. The **Sources** screen and `offline/import-report.json` describe the import.

`Leetcode-Premium-Unlocker-master` and `Leetcode-Premium-Bypass-main` were inspected. They contain browser extensions that depend on online services, rather than standalone problem datasets, so their extension code was not integrated.

Markdown rendering and HTML sanitization use vendored Marked and DOMPurify. Their notices are in `vendor/`; runtime use does not depend on npm or a CDN.

## Refresh the offline pack

The importer uses Python's standard library. It reads sources without modifying them, merges numbered entries by LeetCode ID, matches loose filenames to known titles where possible, and merges identical solution content within each entry while keeping its origins. Titles without a reliable numeric ID stay as solution topics.

```powershell
python scripts/import_offline.py --source-root "C:\Users\surya\Downloads" --download-images
```

`--download-images` retrieves supported diagrams from `assets.leetcode.com`. Existing downloaded images are reused. Omit the flag for a fully local rebuild. Re-run the importer after changing app assets: it fingerprints the pack and application files to version the offline cache. Use **Online / Offline > Check for updates**, then **Apply update & reload** when ready. Close other CodeLab tabs/windows and finish or save/leave the current session first. Click **Save full app for offline** again after updating. Older copies without update controls must first close all app tabs and reopen online.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

The repository includes `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. It builds a clean static artifact from committed question/library data, verifies it, publishes Pages and includes the full offline ZIP. The original Downloads folders and Desktop PDFs are **not needed** for this deployment build.

1. Push the completed project to `main` in `laxtline/Code-Editor-Pro`.
2. In repository **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment**, choose **GitHub Actions** as Source.
3. Run **Publish CodeLab online and offline** under Actions, or push another change to `main`.
4. Use the deployment URL reported by GitHub. For this repository, the expected default URL is `https://laxtline.github.io/Code-Editor-Pro/`; it is live only after a successful deployment.

```powershell
npm ci
npm run build:site
```

`build:site` uses committed data and vendored npm dependencies. It generates `_site/` for hosting, `CodeLab-Offline.html` for portable reading, and `downloads/CodeLab-Offline.zip` for full offline use. Publish **only `_site/`**, which excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, tests, developer scripts and local source folders. All asset paths and service-worker scope work under a repository subpath.


Other static HTTPS hosts can serve the same `_site/` artifact.

Also publish `CodeLab-Offline.html` to enable the **Download single HTML** link. It is approximately 12.3 MiB. The local and hosted editions have separate browser storage origins; use Export/Import Progress to transfer work.

## Rebuild the application

```powershell
npm run build
```

This bundles runtime files, validates the reviewed Classic banks and regenerates explained practice data, Python reference strings, the local library catalog/cache fingerprint and the single-file edition. It uses Python’s standard library and pinned npm runtime packages (run `npm ci` first); the four original Downloads folders are required by the library importer. GitHub reference modules and parsed PDF roadmap data are already stored in `data/`.

To refresh the PDF data after deliberately replacing the reference PDFs:

```powershell
python -m pip install pypdf
python scripts/import_roadmaps.py --pdf-root "C:\Users\surya\Desktop"
npm run build
```

The importer checks the expected step counts/targets and never edits the PDFs.

## Development checks

```powershell
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build:site
npm test
```

The browser checks cover saved coding feedback, rapid draft switching, incomplete-evaluation retries, contest resume, mobile exam controls, the corrected Classic banks, topic-balanced sampling, stable shuffled choices and keyboard scoring, worked-answer review, pack consistency, filtering/pagination, bookmarks/review marks, direct file opening, progress export/import, sanitization, offline reload with unread entries/diagrams, practice scoring/mistakes, section quotas and locking, deadlines, staged coding resume, legacy controls, Monaco draft/model preservation, runtime-unavailable handling and a standalone HTML copied away from all project assets. The packaged app is additionally checked under `/Code-Editor-Pro/`, after offline reopening with real Python/SQL/Monaco engines, and after extracting its ZIP away from the source. Python timeout/restart, full-cache readiness, runtime hashes and manifest icons are verified. All 84 added Python/JavaScript references are checked against explicit expected outputs. The previous 12 data-structure tasks also run deterministic small-input checks against independent brute-force or simpler oracles (linked lists, heaps, subset sum, trees, palindromes, topological ordering and spanning forests). Tests block external requests; the Monaco tests use local bundled/dev files.

The Windows launcher also has an integration check for a folder with spaces/brackets, an occupied port, server reuse, Live Server opening mode and verified stop. It runs without opening the browser during testing.

Update integration checks serve two actual worker revisions and verify session protection, multiple-window protection, draft preservation, cache activation and offline reopening. Backup checks cover immediate drafts, legacy imports, credential exclusion, invalid storage keys and rollback after a simulated quota failure.

Study curriculum sources are maintained in `scripts/curriculum/`; `python scripts/build_study.py` checks all skill mappings and rebuilds `assets/study-data.js` without the private originals. To deliberately reimport an updated technical PDF, install pypdf and run `python scripts/import_study_syllabus.py --help`. Source document basenames and hashes are recorded in `data/study-syllabus.json`; the personal PDFs/DOCX are not published.

New checks also exercise calendar revision intervals, tutorial navigation and mobile layout, immediate lesson notes, HTML preview, all runnable Python/JavaScript/SQL examples (including async), Classic autosave/timing, visual sets, and two real localhost origins sharing a private temporary-folder backup. API token/origin checks, private-path blocking, tombstones, credential exclusion, restarted-server tokens and process time/output limits are verified. Available native compilers are tested with real programs and compile errors; absent compilers are reported explicitly. The 18 newest algorithms additionally run deterministic exhaustive/simpler small-input oracles in both reference languages.
